Version 3.0.0 build 8825 / 2022-March-10

[new] Full version now includes USB driver for Virus TI users.
    Users with macOS 10.15 and beyond can now connect to
    "Virus TI USB Plugin I/O" with Virus TI.
    (yes, Big Sur and Monterey users as well).
    Audio has to be routed from Virus to sound card or console,
    but we are investigating...
    
    Addendum:
    USB seems to be very slow, so if you have MIDI device,
    use that instead!

[fixed] Resolved issue where MIDI data was not properly handled causing
    continuous Device ID checks.
[fixed] Resolved issue where bank edit indicator did not display when
    requesting data from hardware to librarian.
